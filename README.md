# LNMIIT_Management

## Area of Work
The project focuses on creating an android application to digitally manage various Academic as well as Non-academic services provided by the institution. 
The android application provides various services like - Bus Service, Leave Management, Medical Appointment, Medical Certificate and Dispensary Management, etc. 

## Problem Addressed
Our project has tried to convert the existing system(manual) to digital system. Using our application, a student can easily book a seat in the bus, apply for a  leave, request for a medical certificate or appointment at just one click. 
The request sent by the student is then answered by the concerned authority, using the application. This way, the application provides a fast and an easy means to manage such services.

We have tried to address the issue of maintaining the manual record for the bus travel, the medical checkup, the medical certificate and the hostel leave. 
We have tried to build an android application that would reduce human effort and save time by providing best possible service to the user.

## Project Overview
There are a lot of services provided by the institution to the students and the faculty. A few of them being the bus service, medical treatment, leave facility, etc. These services come with the need to manage them. 
Managing large records manually sounds like a tiring and tedious process. Since, the records can be very large, it is sensible to use an android application for the same, that would help manage it easily. 
Hence, our project, LNMIIT Management Android Application, provides services to manage all the above mentioned services digitally, at just one click.


Our project provides an easy way to book a seat in the LNMIIT bus on a particular day, request for a medical certificate, schedule an appointment with a doctor, request for a leave, at just one click. 
Using the android application, it would be easier for the students to use these services, and for the concerned authorities to provide these services. 
The android application also brings a relief in maintaining a stack of records manually, for all the data is being stored on a web server. Hence, it also gets easier to analyze the data, if needed.


The android application provides a very easy to understand UI for the users in order to fully use the application and hence the services provided by the application. 
We have built this application, with the intention to make the life a bit easier for the authorities and the students of our institution. We have ensured to provide the best service keeping it secure and easy to manage. 
Using the application would definitely save a lot of human effort and time.
